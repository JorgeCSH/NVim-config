# NeoVim repository

## About
This repository contains my config and options that I have done on my Vim-based code editor, thus I prevent losing them in case I make a mistake.
If you are reading this and like my editor, feel free to make a fork and use it :D. If there's anything that should be improved just let me know! I will be happy to give it a look[^1].

Anything used from another source will have its respective reference, as well as any suggestions if he likes the idea.

Also, I use the Nvim "0 to LSP; Neovim RC From Scratch" video from [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) as a starter point.

## Final words
Uh...for now I don't have any final words, so...yes, enjoy (or suffer) with my text editor.

## Future updates[^3]
* Change file explorer, the one I added was the first one I found

## Config:[^2]
* [space]ex: to exit from the file you are editing, NOT FROM VIM
* [space]pf: search between projects files
* [space]ps: search bwtween projects
* [space]fb: toggle file browser

[^1]: For now, October 5th, I'm still a bit of a newbie for you to know.
[^2]: For now that are the options that I have made, or well, what I think they do...
[^3]: Currently I don't have much time but I will make the changes sometime in the future.
