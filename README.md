# NeoVim repository

## About
This repository contains my config and options that I have done on my Vim-based code editor, thus I prevent losing them in case I make a mistake.
If you are reading this and like my editor, feel free to make a fork and use it :D. If there's anything that should be improved just let me know! I will be happy to give it a look[^1].

Anything used from another source will have its respective reference, as well as any suggestions if he likes the idea.

## Final words
Uh...for now I don't have any final words, so...yes, enjoy (or suffer) with my text editor.

## References

[^1]: For now, October 5th, I'm still a bit of a newbie for you to know.
