# NeoVim Repository

## About
This repository contains my configurations and options for my Vim-based code editor, serving as a backup to avoid losing them in case of mistakes.  
If you're reading this and like my setup, feel free to fork and use it :D! If you have suggestions or improvements, let me know, I’d be happy to take a look[^1].

Anything sourced from elsewhere will have proper references, along with any credit for ideas I adopt.

I used [ThePrimeagen's](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen) ["0 to LSP; Neovim RC From Scratch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) video as a starting point for my setup.

## Final Words
For now, I don't have any final thoughts, so... enjoy (or suffer) with my text editor.

## Future Updates[^3]
* Replace the file explorer (the current one was the first I found).

## Configurations[^2]:
* `[space]ex`: Exit the current file (not Neovim).
* `[space]pf`: Search within project files.
* `[space]ps`: Search across projects.
* `[space]fb`: Toggle file browser.

[^1]: For now, October 5th, I'm still a bit of a newbie for you to know.
[^2]: For now that are the options that I have made, or well, what I think they do...
[^3]: I don’t have much time right now, but I plan to make changes in the future.
