# NeoVim Repository, now starring lazy as a package manager

## About
This repository contains my configurations and options for my Vim-based code editor, serving as a backup to avoid losing them in case of mistakes. This repository/branch is an updated version of a previous one, where I have finally changed the package manager from ```Packer``` to ```Lazy.nvim```. 
If you're reading this and like my setup, feel free to fork and use it :D! If you have suggestions or improvements, let me know, I’d be happy to take a look[^1].

Anything sourced from elsewhere will have proper references, along with any credit for ideas I adopt.

I used [ThePrimeagen's](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen) ["0 to LSP; Neovim RC From Scratch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) video as a starting point for my setup.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Copy the "nvim" directory into your .config directory.
3. Navigate to the nvim directory and type ```nvim .``` to access the current directory in ``Neovim mode''. If everything goes correctly, Lazy (the package manager) should begin the installation process. 
4. After Lazy finishes cooking[^6], you should be able to use this Neovim configuration. It is recommended to explore all the options the package manager offers before quitting..
5. For icons, install Nerd Fonts using either sudo apt-get install ```nerd-fonts``` (for Debian-based systems) or ```sudo pacman -S nerd-fonts``` (for Arch-based systems). You can choose the one you prefer. IMPORTANT: Not all fonts work, so please verify that the one you choose is compatible.
6. (extra) If you want Copilot[^5], you need to install it from the official repository using git clone, just like with Packer.

## Final Words
For now, I don't have any final thoughts, so... enjoy (or suffer) with my text editor.

## Future Updates[^3]
* ~~Replace the file explorer (the current one was the first I found).~~
* ~~Replace the greeter.~~
* Setup Tmux.
* Customize the greeter.
